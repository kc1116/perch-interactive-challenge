## perch-iot-pubsub simulator

Start a simulation that attempts to mimick a real perch session with a device

### Synopsis

The simulator attempts to do random actions during sessions just like a real person. A session
		can be considered a person coming into contact with our IOT device. Every action this person takes is considered 
		an event and published through GCP IOT Core MQTT Bridge. Each session will not last as long as others this duration 
		is randomized between 5s & 180. A Simulated device acts like it's own independent entity. Thus sessions are independent
		from each other. The frequency in which events occur in a simulated session is a randomized number between 5s and 30s. 
		You can increase the amount of concurrent sessions (default: 2).
